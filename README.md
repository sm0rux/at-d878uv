This is the code plug to my Anytone AT-D878UV. I use CPS version 1.12 and firmware 1.12.

DMR and FM repeaters in Sweden is included so far. Also D-STAR/FM duo mode repeaters are included in FM mode if I have information they use sub tone on their TX.

I will also make individual zones for each Swedish call area.

Maybe I then add DMR repeaters in OZ, LA and OH/OH0. Maybe you want to help me?
